# Prep Problem 6

Write a program that can print the state of water, based on it's temperature in fahrenheit.
As you might alrady know, 32 degrees is freezing temperature, and boiling temperature (at which water can turn to steam) is 212.
The program should accept one number (a temp in fahrenheit) and then it should determine the "state" of the water, based on the temp.
You should try to accomplish this without using `elif`.
Examples are shown below.

```
Temperature in fahrenheit:
100
Water
```

```
Temperature in fahrenheit:
20
Ice
```

```
Temperature in fahrenheit:
230
Steam
```

Name the program `prep6.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
