# Prep Problem 8

Write a program that can accept one input, a positive integer.
You don't have to write any if-statements to ensure that it is actually positive.
The program should print out every number between 0 and the input value, inclusive.
You should use a while loop for this, which is covered in 4.2 of the book.

Below are a few examples:

```
Enter a positive number:
5

0
1
2
3
4
5
```

```
Enter a positive number:
10

0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

Name the program `prep8.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
