# Prep Problem 2

Write a program that prints out text-based face, with customizable eyes.
The face should look like so:

```
|||||||
| o o |
|  _  |
 -----
```

However, the letter that is used for the eyes (in the example above, an "o") should be customizable by the user.

For instance, shown below are two runs of the program:

```
Eye style:
x

|||||||
| x x |
|  _  |
 -----
```

```
Eye style:
&

|||||||
| & & |
|  _  |
 -----
```

Name the program `prep2.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
