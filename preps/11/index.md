# Prep Problem - 11

You should have read about the basics of functions in the reading.
In this prep, you will be tasked with writing two, very simple functions.
These should be void functions, that do not accept and parameters or have a return value.
The first function should be named `triangle` and should print out exactly this:

```
 /\
/  \
----
```

The second function should be named `rectangle` and should print out exactly this:

```
+--+
|  |
|  |
+--+
```

You may call the functions in your code in order to test.
However, you should remove all calls to the function before you submit to gradescope.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.

Name the program `prep11.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
