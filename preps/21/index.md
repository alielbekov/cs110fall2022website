# Prep Problem - 21


In this problem, you should write one function named `two_words`.
This function should accept one parameter, which you can assume will be a list with one or more strings in it, each being a word.
Using a for-loop, the function should determine the word that would come first and last in the alphabet from the list of words.
The function should *return* these two words concatenated together, with one space in-between.
The alphabetically0earlier word should be first.
A few examples:

* The function call `two_words(['tree', 'forest', 'antelope', 'zebra'])` should return the string `'antelope zebra'`.
* The function call `two_words(['zoo', 'champion', 'fetch', 'those', 'lemurs'])` should return the string `'champion zoo'`.

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep21.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
