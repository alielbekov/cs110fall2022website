# Prep Problem - 19

The task of this prep is to write a function named `multiply`, that behaves in the same way as the prep 18 function.
The difference is that you are not allowed to use a while-loop, and you are required to use a for-loop.
If you don't know what a for-loop is, read the reading!
Refer to prep 18 for examples of arguments and return values.

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep19.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
