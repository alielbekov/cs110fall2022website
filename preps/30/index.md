# Prep Problem - 30

In this problem, you should write one function named `copy_and_increment`.
This function will have one parameter, which you can assume will be a list of integers.
This function should return a copy of the parameter list, in which each number from the parameter list has been increased by 1.
The function should not modify the values in the parameter list.
For example, the code:

```
values = [20, 40, 10, 60, 77, 2]
other = copy_and_increment(values)
print(values)
print(other)
```

Should print

```
[20, 40, 10, 60, 77, 2]
[21, 41, 11, 61, 78, 3]
```

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep30.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
