# Prep Problem - 29

In this problem, you should write one function named `differences`.
This function should have two parameters, which you can assume will both be sets with zero or more values.
This function should calculate and return the number of elements that are different (not in common) between the two parameter sets.
For example:

* `differences({1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4, 5})` should return 3
* `differences({'john', 'mark', 'paul'}, {'john', 'mark'})` should return 1

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep29.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
