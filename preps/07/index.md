# Prep Problem 7

Write a program that can accept two inputs, A drink size and drink type.
You can assume that the size will always be either 'large' or 'small'.
You can assume that the type will always be either 'regular', 'diet', or 'water'.
The program should print out the corresponding calories of the drink, based on the table below:

| type | size | calories |
| regular | large | 300 |
| regular | small | 150 |
| diet | large | 100 |
| diet | small | 50 |
| water | large | 0 |
| water | small | 0 | 

```
Drink Size:
large
Drink type:
regular

300 calories
```

```
Drink Size:
small
Drink type:
water

0 calories
```

Name the program `prep7.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
