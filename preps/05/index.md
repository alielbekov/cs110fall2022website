# Prep Problem 5

Write a program that can accept two inputs - a food type and a price, and determines if the food is affordable or expensive.
This program should use an if-statement to determine.
If the cost of the food is over $20, then the program should say it is expensive, and otherwise it should say it is affordable (this is arbitrary - for the purposes of making this problem simple).

Below are a few examples:

```
Enter food:
hamburger
Enter price:
30
That hamburger is expensive.
```

```
Enter food:
prime rib
Enter price:
5
That prime rib is affordable.
```

Name the program `prep5.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
