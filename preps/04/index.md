# Prep Problem 4

Write a program that can convert a length in feet to multiple other units of measurement.
Your program should be capable of converting feet to three other units: inches, meters, and rods.

* As you probably already know, and inch is 1/12th of a foot.
* A meter is 0.3048 of a foot
* A rod is a special kind of measure, sometimes used by land surveyors, that has a length of exactly 16 and 1/2 feet per rod.
  An acre of land is 160 square rods.

Your program should accept one number from the user, convert it to an integer, and print out the three conversions.
You should round the meters to three decimal places, and the rods to one, using the `round` function.
For instance:


```
Number of feet:
100

Inches: 1200
Meter: 30.48
Rods: 6.1
```

```
Number of feet:
5

Inches: 60
Meter: 1.524
Rods: 0.3
```

Name the program `prep4.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
