# Prep Problem - 25

In this problem, you should write one function named `every_other`.
This function should have one parameter, which will be a string with one or more space-separated words in it.
The function should return a string with every-other word from the parameter string.
I recommend that you follow these steps:

* (A) Split the parameter sting on the space character (use the `string.split()` function)
* (B) Create a variable to store the shorter string
* (C) loop through every-other string form the list of words, concatenating them to the result string.
* (D) Return the result string

Shown below are a few examples:

* `every_other('one fish two fish red fish blue fish')` should return `'one two red blue'`
* `every_other('these are words')` should return `'these words'`

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep25.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
