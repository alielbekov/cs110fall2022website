# Prep Problem - 39

Write a program that print out the string "Hi there!".
The exact output of the program should be:

```
Hi there!
```

Hmmm, this seems familiar.
Oh, how far you've come!
Give yourself a pat on the back.
Bravo.
Name the program `prep39.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
