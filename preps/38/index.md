# Prep Problem - 38

In this problem, you should write one function named `get_highest_sum`.
This function should have one parameters, a 2D list of numeric values.
This should should look at every pair of integers in each row, and return the highest sum.

For instance, the code:

```
grid = [[5, 4, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 2, 9, 1, 2, 0, 9, 9],
        [1, 2, 1, 2, 0]]
result = get_highest_sum(grid)
print(result)
```

Should print

```
18
```

Due to the `9` next to another `9` on the second row.

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep38.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
