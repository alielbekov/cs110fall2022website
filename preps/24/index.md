# Prep Problem - 24

In this problem, you should write one function named `count_vowels`.
This function should have three parameters.
The first is a string of text, the second and third should be integers, which I will refer to as A and B.
The function should count how many vowels (a, e, i, o, u) exist in the first parameter, between the indexes A and B (inclusive on both ends).
The function should return this count.
Shown below are a few examples:

* `count_vowels('one fish two fish', 2, 10)` should return `2`
* `count_vowels('kiwis and oranges are good', 10, 25)` should return `7`
* `count_vowels('aeiouaeiouaeiou', 5, 12)` should return `8`

Make sure to include only the one function in your file.
The gradescope tests will call the functions to test them.
Name the program `prep24.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case.
