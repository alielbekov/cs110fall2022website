# Prep Problem 9

Write a program that can accept one input, a positive integer.
The program should calculate the factorial value for that number.
In mathematical terms, the factorial of a number N is the product of positive integers between 1 and N.
So for instance:

* . . .
* 4 factorial = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4) = 24
* 5 factorial = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5) = 120
* 6 factorial = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 ) = 720
* 7 factorial = (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 * 6 * 7) = 5040
* . . .

Use a while-loop to calculate and print the factorial for the input number.
For instance:

```
Enter factorial to calculate:
5

5 factorial = 120
```

Name the program `prep9.py`.
Make sure that gradescope gives you the points for passing the test case(s).
